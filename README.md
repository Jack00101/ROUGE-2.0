# ROUGE-2.0
ROUGE 2.0 is a Java Package for Evaluation of Summarization Tasks building on the Perl Implementation of ROUGE. ROUGE 2.0 currently supports the following:

- Evaluation of ROUGE-N (unigram, bigrams, trigrams, etc)
- Stemming for different languages
- Stopword removal with customizable stop words
- Evalutation of unicode texts (e.g. Persian)
- Synonyms capture for better agreement between system and reference summaries [English only and requires WordNet installation]
- Evaluation of specific parts of speech (e.g. NN) [Uses Stanford POS Tagger]

This is an open-source project, so if you want to implement other measures, please read the documentation on how to contribute to this project.
